== Getting Kibana Up and Running
You can set up Kibana and start exploring your Elasticsearch indexes in minutes.
All you need is:

* Elasticsearch 1.4.0 or later
* An up-to-date web browser 

=== Install and Start Kibana
To get Kibana up and running:

. Download the http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/installation/[Kibana binary package] for your platform.
. Extract the `.zip` or `tar.gz` archive file.
. Run Kibana from the install directory: `bin/kibana` (Linux/MacOSX) or `bin/kibana.bat` (Windows).

That's it! Kibana is now running on port 5601.

=== Connect Kibana with Elasticsearch 	
Before you can start using Kibana, you need to tell it which Elasticsearch index(es) you want to explore. The first time
you access Kibana, you are prompted to define an _index pattern_ that matches the name of one or more of your indexes. That's it. That's all you need to configure to start using Kibana. 

TIP: You can add index patterns at any time from the <<settings-create-pattern,Settings tab>>.

To configure the Elasticsearch index(es) you want to access with Kibana:

. Point your browser at port 5601 to access the Kibana UI. For example, `localhost:5601` or `http://YOURDOMAIN.com:5601`.

. Specify an index pattern that matches the name of one or more of your Elasticsearch indexes. By default, Kibana guesses that you're you're working with log data being fed into Elasticsearch by Logstash. If that's the case, you can use the default `logstash-*` as your index pattern. The asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters in an index's name. If your Elasticsearch indexes follow some other naming convention, enter an appropriate pattern.  (The "pattern" can also simply be the name of a single index.)
. Select the index field that contains the timestamp you want to use. Kibana reads the index mapping to find fields that contain a timestamp. 
. Click *Create* to add the index pattern.

Voila! Kibana is now connected to your Elasticsearch data.

=== Start Exploring your Data!
You're ready to dive in to your data:

* Search and browse your data interactively from the <<discover,Discover>> tab. 
* Chart and map your data from the <<visualize, Visualize>> tab. 
* Create and view custom dashboards from the <<dashboard, Dashboard>> tab.
