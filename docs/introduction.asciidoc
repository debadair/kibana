== Introduction

Kibana is an open source (Apache Licensed) analytics and visualization tool 
for Elasticsearch. You use Kibana to search, view, and interact with data in
Elasticsearch indexes. You can easily perform time-based comparisons and 
visualize your data using a variety of charts, tables, and maps. 

Kibana makes it easy to understand large volumes of data. Its simple,
browser-based interface enables you to quickly create and share dynamic
dashboards that display changes to Elasticsearch queries in real time.

Setting up Kibana is a snap. You can install Kibana and start exploring your
Elasticsearch indexes in minutes--no code, no additional infrastructure required.
